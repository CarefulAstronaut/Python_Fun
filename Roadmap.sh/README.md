# Roadmap.sh
 This is going to be the start of my journey back into DataScience learning after some time away on the PM and DataOps side.  My goal is to use the roadmaps and track my learning in jupyter notebooks. 
 
 As of writing, I have 4 distinct roadmpas that I'm looking to follow:
 AI & Data Science: https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist
 Python: https://roadmap.sh/python
 PostgreSQL-DBA: https://roadmap.sh/postgresql-dba
 Backend: https://roadmap.sh/backend (mostly for version control to start)

in the words of Mario: "Here we go!"
