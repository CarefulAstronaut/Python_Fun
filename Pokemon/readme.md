# Pokemon Charts
### Quarantine Week 1

## Rationale

This project was done to practice graphing with Matplotlib - I learned some new things and practiced some techniques.  Felt nice to get back into coding.

## Included Files

This project was done entirely with the Pokemon datset from Kaggle. It houses a list of all Pokemon from Gen 1-6, including Name, Subtype 1/2, Legendary status, Generation, and the base stats for each of the 6 attributes.  
Data =  [https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)

## Libararies

This repo uses some basic python libraries to dig through the data.  Most of this work is done through visualiations and grouping buckets together, but I did get to practice loops and list creation as well. 

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Summary
This project was designed to understand a bit more about Pokemon subtypes between generations.  I never played the games beyond Gen 1 and wanted to see if there are vast differences between them. 

It was interesting to see that the number of new Pokemon introduced in each generation follows a "Tick-Tock" cadence.  Gen 1, 3, and 5 all have ~160 Pokemon, but 2, 4, and 6 have ~100 each. I'd have to go back and see if this is tied to major releases of games. It was clear some types of Pokemon were favored in some generations (Psychic, Gen 3; Water, Gen 1/3).  More reading would be required but I wonder if it's tied to a plot line of the games or just a balancing from the developers.  It's clear from the radar chart that Psychic Pokemon have a base advantage in stats over most other types, but looking back I wonder if this is just skewed from the inclusion of Legendary Pokemon.  In retrospective, it would've been more impactful to include average bast stats of only non-Legendary Pokemon.
