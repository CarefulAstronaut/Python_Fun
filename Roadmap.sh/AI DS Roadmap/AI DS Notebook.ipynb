There is a *actual* data, and then the formulaic *guesses*.  We can take the sum of squares from the differences (residuals) in our expected values to our actual values, and measure the goodness/badness of fit (also called the **SSR - Sum of Squared Residuals**). Over many guesses, we could create a contour for the fit of each of our variables. \n",
